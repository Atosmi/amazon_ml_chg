# Amazon ML Challenge 2023

This repository contains my team's attempt at creating an ML model for the Amazon ML Challenge 2023. The challenge was to create an ML model that could read a text description of an Amazon product, along with its product ID, and predict its length. The dataset for this challenge contained **2.2 million lines of data**!

## Jupyter Notebooks

The repo contains two Jupyter notebooks:

- `clean.ipynb`: This notebook cleans the dataset and makes it ready for ML algorithms to be applied.

- `train.ipynb`: This notebook uses BERT model, to score the clean data and applies ML models to generate a prediction!

This attempt was able to generate a success rate of ~46% for the class we trained for. 

Thank you for reading. If you have any suggestions for the model, do raise an issue. I'd love to hear from you.
