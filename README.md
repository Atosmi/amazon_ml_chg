# Dimension Genie

The challenge was to create an ML model that could read a text description of an Amazon product, along with its product ID, and predict its length. The dataset for this challenge contained **2.2 million lines of data**!

## Jupyter Notebooks

The repo contains two Jupyter notebooks:

- `clean.ipynb`: This notebook cleans the dataset and makes it ready for ML algorithms to be applied.

- `train.ipynb`: This notebook uses BERT model, to score the clean data and applies ML models to generate a prediction!

This attempt was able to generate a success rate of ~46% for the class it was trained for. 

Thank you for reading. If you have any suggestions for the model, do raise an issue. I'd love to hear from you.
